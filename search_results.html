            Argent-chan,

I am a current student at Oxford and I specifically registered so that I could contribute.

Academic achievement is closely interlinked to academic potential, and your academic achievement does not indicate that you have the required academic potential for Oxford. Even if you truly are Oxford material - your application is likely to be thrown out before you can make a meaningful impression at interviews - simply because there are too many applicants and even if you do have what it takes at Oxford, you have not demonstrated it compared to another applicant of similar capability but have done so.

I was in a similar situation with you, having obtained B C and E at my only A Levels a couple of years back. Indeed many have given me the advice to simply join a less academically rigorous university and then proceed to Oxford for graduate study if I truly wanted to.

But I didn't want to simply go to Oxford.

I took the bold choice of redoing my pre-university education (another 2 years, yes!). The world was against me, much like they are against you now. Yet I knew, genuinely, that I was capable of attaining the very best this time round.

I applied to Oxford with perfect predicted grades, an astonishing testimonial and backed it up with perfect SAT scores (in hindsight it was ridiculous to include it into my UCAS application although legally I was obliged to).

If you truly want to retake the A Levels, I urge you to consider within you the purpose it will serve. If you simply are taking the A Levels to defer entry into university with the hope that somehow things will change, I'm afraid you will be sorely disappointed in another two years. But if you have removed whatever obstacles that are currently hindering you, and are ready to do what it takes and know with a high degree of certainty that you will succeed, I wish you all the best.

This comment took a while to process, apologises for not getting back to you sooner! Thank you for joining for the purpose of contributing! I am very glad for your input. 

Out of interest, which A levels do you have? (First lot and second lot?) And what about your GCSEs? What was your 'astonishing testimonial'? I never planned on waiting for things to change. Am in the process of hindering obstacles so that next year when I start afresh I will have the best possible chance. I have am certain even with my grades so far that I will be able to pull them up to all As. I can do that, as long as my GCSEs and such have not already wrecked my chances. You have just proved that two extra years does not mean that it's the end of everything. Which I am grateful to know!

If all ends badly I can always apply to another University if I do not get the grades, but is it really unreasonable to aim for Oxford? I really want to try. If there is any possibility at all of getting in. I sound so pathetic, but I really want this.
        <br /><br /><div style='width:100%;height:15px;background-color:blue;color:blue;'></div>
            No you don't. Quit while you're ahead. 

a) Grades aren't everything
b) if you need random people to assure you that you can APPLY then maybe you shouldn't apply because you need to have some confidence in yourself to not start crying as soon as you come across somehting you don't know
c) You don't loose anything by trying. Every case is different. If YOU want to apply to Oxford, then APPLY to Oxford.

And this pretty much goes for every single 'Am I good enough for Oxford?'

If you don't apply then you will never know. That's the only sure way of telling.

            I just found out I'm predicted a 37 with 2 7s and a 6 at HL (guessing this part). I was quite disappointed because I am almost sure I can get above a 40 (with a 777 at HL) at the rate I'm going. I'm just seriously worried that this will affect my chances at getting even an interview. Thing is I have American qualifications that meet and exceed what they ask for, but I just can't get over the fact that I might be rejected because of a under-prediction (obviously there are a plethora of other reasons, too, why I might be rejected ).

Convincing myself that after I meet the American requirement its all the TSA, PS, and interview

                Sry but the deadline was 15th of october which was 3 days ago so even if u did want to apply u cant ...shouldve brainstormed about this earlier :P
            
        
    

No I know that. I'll apply after I'm done with A levels. I know people don't usually do that but let's just say I got unfinished business  

Plus I was thinking more along the lines of going to US but since it's A levels and my grades are kinda good.......I'd like to still apply.

            I'm a Canadian student studying in the province of Ontario applying to Law... Can anyone shed some light on my competitiveness, as an international student?

Last year I had a 89.6% average.  I already completed four "4U" courses last year, with a 92.8% average.  I expect my top six "4U" courses to have a 93-94% average.  

I will have my OSSD in June.

I wrote LNAT.  I don't have my score, but scored 25-30 on the practice tests provided on the LNAT website.

I also submitted a horrible SAT score.  However, Oxford does not require this from Canadian students.
        <br /><br /><div style='width:100%;height:15px;background-color:blue;color:blue;'></div>
            I'm an American looking forward to applying someday for a Modern Language degree. My problem is being evaluated for my foreign language skills. German is what I'm studying and I was homeschooled so I never took a proper class, everything was self-taught. My question is - would taking/passing a Goethe Institute Exam be equivalent to the grade that is set for the foreign language requirement that Oxford sets? 

The website states: "Candidates would usually be expected to have the language or languages to A-level, Advanced Higher, Higher Level in the IB or another academic equivalent."

                Why were your subjests self taught and which ones? and why only in 6 months?
            
        
    

The school was rubbish - they decided that my year should sit A levels early, and so they finished GCSE in Year 10. I tried to move to the school for Year 10, but of course they were a year into their GCSE's by then, so I had to go to Year 9 - who were just starting GCSE. 

I completed half a year in Year 9, a condensced Year 9 curriculum designed to be finished by January, but then the year above - my real year, did so horribly on their GCSE exams in January that the school changed their mind, and Year 9 changed back to the 'real' Year 9 curriculum. So I was a Year 10 in Year 9 doing the Year 9 curriculum. The Year 10's completed the rest of their GCSE exams in the June, and I sat my 'Year 9 SATS'. 
Follow so far?

Beginning of 'Year 10' - when I should have been in Year 11. I should have been taught half of my GCSE course by then, but instead had ended up repeating Year 9. First year of GCSE's started for the Year 10's, and I could not learn the second year stuff as the other Year 11's started As - there was no second year of GCSE's running. 

The school took a few months to sort itself out, and the Year 10s didn't actually start the GCSE course straight away, instead learning the stuff they missed due to the 'condensced curriculum' at the start of Year 9. In December I was pulled from classes, handed a stack of textbooks, and told to go teach myself 2 years worth of stuff in the time period between then and the beginning of exams halfway through May. Needless to say - it was pretty ****.

ah... right! Well that explains it :P I guess that would count as extenuating circumstances, and they will most likely afford you more leeway for your grades and any gaps in knowledge at interview. Make sure you explain in the application, and try and stick to the facts, saying things like "the school was rubbish" might come across a bit whiney, especially as it was a grammar school. They have systems to monitor all school which are  underperforming or in low income areas etc. so they will know what it is like, dw  and good luck! 
and genuinely, don't worry about not having "contacts" or being upper class, or lower class. Oxford really couldn't care less :P x

            Hello! 
Okay so recently I visited a University local to me (i live in the UK) for a programme called "Gifted and Talented" where I looked at a few prospectuses as I have been interested in studying Law for a while, and since I have researched the topic thoroughly, I have decided that I would like to study Law in University. I have always had my heart set on Oxford as I feel that it would be such an amazing experience and I realise that they really study the subjects in great depth and detail which would really be truly incredible as I really am passionate about studying Law and in my opinion I think that Oxford would help me achieve my fullest potential. 
So now rant is over, but I am currently in Year 11 in Comprehensive school and have so far been predicted the following grades:
Math: B / A
English: A*
History: B / A
RE: A
Science: A
Science (additional) : A
Catering: A*
French: A
Welsh: A
Welsh Baccalaureate: Pass (equivalent to 3 GCSE's)
So those are my predicted grades so far. Maths is really the only one which I find slightly difficult, but I am thinking of getting a tutor to make sure I achieve an A!
For AS and A Level, these are the subjects I hope to take:
Law
English
Biology
Ancient History
As I wish to do Law at University, I feel that by taking Law at A level, I will have some background knowledge on the subject. Do you think that these subjects are academic enough for Oxford? I believe that if I put in full effort and work to my absolute best, I could probably achieve A / A* for all of these subjects (especially English)! 
The current 'achievements' I have accomplished so far are:
-Swimming (I used to belong to a swimming club and had swimming lessons from age 4-11)
-Piano, started at age 13 and am now 15, on Grade 5 and planning on completing all grades.
-Gifted and Talented (only a few students in my year at school were chosen for this.)
-Volunteered for Barnardos for a few weeks (for Welsh Bacc)
-Have had a French exchange Student.
-Planning on going to Camp America during summer of A levels
-Planning on getting a job when I turn 16 (in June)
-Planning on going to UNIQ summer school (for Oxford)
-I volunteer for walking people's dogs around the village I live in
And those are all of the things I can think off the top of my head, but if you would like to know more (to be able to answer my question more thoroughly) then email me at [Removed - please use PMs or post here]
The School I attend is relevantly small but is a School (which you have to apply to to be able to attend) with around 550 pupils.

Basing on the criteria that have provided (obviously I know that I would have to take the LNAT and interviews, but provided I do those decently..) do you personally think that I have a chance of getting into Oxford University? It has been my life's dream!! Thank you for reading this, as I would like to see if it is a realistic aim for myself. But, if I do achieve AAA at A level (predicted) then I will apply as I have nothing to lose! But realistically do you think I have a chance? 
Thank you for reading, Florence

Your subjects are fine, although I believe Oxford prefer English Literature over English Language, but I'm not 100% on that. You don't need to have studied law at A-Level to do law at University, and from what I understand they'd much rather you did a "traditional" subject.  As for your GCSEs, the average applicant has around 6-8 A*s and GCSEs do play quite an important factor for admissions at Oxford, especially for non-science subjects. So, if you were to achieve those GCSEs predicted, you would be at a slight disadvantage compared to other applicants. 

Also, your extra-curriculars are great to put on your personal statement but if you're doing them to come across as impressive, it's totally futile. Universities, especially Oxbridge, only are really bothered by academics; in fact, you'd be far far more likely to receive an offer if you dropped all your extra-curricular ideas and got all A*s at GCSE and all As at A-Level. If you really do all these things because you're a lovely and very interested person, that's great and good on you, but I get the impression you're doing half of this stuff to impress (seeing as you're doing a lot of the clich things).

Of course you stand a chance, if you do well at GCSE/A-Level, perform decently on the LNAT and interview, all you can do is try. I would say, don't become overly focused on getting into Oxford, because statistically speaking, you're not likely to get in, because most applicants don't.

                Thanks for the informative response! Really appreciate it.

Some more questions: What A Levels did you do? And do you think you were at all disadvantaged (in regard to your PS) from not having PPE all around, having to adjust your PS to impress for other courses?

Workload sounds reasonable. Don't know about getting up at 9 everyday, though! It sounds like it was pretty easy to make friends, socialise etc....and the course looks genuinely interesting. I take it you don't have the freedom to pick your modules in your first year? Is that particularly restrictive?
            
        
    

I did Economics, Maths, History and German

I don't think I was disadvantaged with my PS... I wrote it for PPE and got offers from everywhere except one of my PPE choices. So clearly it wasn't a problem. I think universities are aware that not everyone applies to identical courses at every university, especially when not all that many offer a course (as is the case with PPE). As long as you're not applying for Medicine at 3 and PPE at 2 it really shouldn't be too much of a problem - slight variances are unavoidable in a fair number of cases. 

As your UCAS form will arrive before the Oxbridge deadline at all your choices, they'll know it's more than likely you've applied to Oxbridge and hence have probably written the PS with that course in mind. Whether they take offence at that - not in my case, but perhaps others have had a different experience. As an aside I have a friend who wrote "I want to study History at Oxford..." in the opening line of his PS (perhaps slightly more eloquently, but definitely referred to Oxford) and still got 3 other offers. 

In my experience most universities have set modules in the first year - with perhaps outside options being the only choice you have (no outside options at Oxford). They need to set a good groundwork, since everyone will have a different level of knowledge. PPE first year is a broad introduction to the 3 disciplines - but I wouldn't say it feels restrictive. Within each I felt there's enough breadth to find the areas which interest you more. For example in Politics you do political philosophy (e.g. Mill / Marx) and study politics of democracies (e.g. US/UK/France). In your first year exams you need to answer 4 questions with at least one question from each area. So I did 1 on Marx and 3 on democracies because that's the weighting I preferred and knew that throughout the year.

Ah right, thanks. I prefer political philosophy and I was a little worried that I'd be "forced" into studying political structures. Can you specialise away from politics in your second and third years? I heard you can drop it completely?

I reckon I'd apply for:

Philosophy and Eco - LSE
"                       " - UCL
Business Eco and Philosophy - Exeter (flexi combined)
PPE - Oxbridge

What do you think? I've heard some horror stories about Warwick, so I think I'll stay away. What's up with that place? Does anyone get in? 

I do Economics, Geography, Maths, Further Maths. Do you think you could recommend me some books to read? I've read some introductory books so far (to Philosophy/ Political Philosophy): Think by Blackburn, On Liberty by Mill and Philosophy by Nicholas Fearn. Thanks

                Hello 

Don't worry about not having GCSEs per se - you just put down on the form whatever your equivalent is in Canada for exams taken before the IB. The tutors have information on these to help them compare against students applying with GCSEs and other international equivalents.  It may be worth asking the teacher doing your reference to include some comment on your marks, for example by indicating how you did in comparison to the rest of your year.

The work experience is good material for your PS. Oxford won't really be bothered about your volunteering/sports although if you are applying to other English universities they might be, in which case it is worth a short mention in your PS if you have room.

Don't forget the LNAT 
            
        
    

Thanks for the reply  
I do know that the GCSE equivalent in Canada is grade 11 (first year sixth form). 
Which is IB, but I still do get graded as a percentage. Do you think i could use those marks as my GCSE's instead of my marks previous to IB? My problem is that my marks before IB were not the greatest... 

Also thanks for the information about the work experience and volunteer/sports! 
I'm kind of annoyed that British universities don't care about all my extra curriculars when compared to north american universities 

Haha i won't forgot about the LNAT's! They're taking place at the same time as my midterms

I thought Grade 11 was ages 16-17, which would be the year after GCSE examinations for UK students. 

We sit the majority of our GCSEs in Year 11, aged 15-16. We then sit AS Levels in Lower Sixth (Year 12) aged 16-17 and then A2s in Upper Sixth (Year 13) aged 17-18. AS and A2 are added together to get the A Level grade.

Also I didn't think there was a set day for the LNAT, it just has to be taken between 1st Sept and 20 Oct - or is it just because you're overseas that there is only one day you can do it on?

                It sounds like you'll be able to put in a strong application.  Your GCSEs and current AS results are looking good.

Your charity work won't get you into Oxford, but your EPQ sounds exciting!

tooambitious's advice is definitely right: Oxford don't know what UMS you get (although if you post them on here, wandering tutors could see I suppose...) 
            
        
    

If you think we'll be able to link postings here and now to real applications under a different name in 7 months time, then you're over-estimating us.  


    
    
    
        
            
                (Original post by fluteflute) 
                so get 80% (A grade) and you're fine... (but you will need to get an average of 90% in C3&C4 to get the Maths A* that you need to get into Oxford). STEP plays no part in Oxford entry.

It's the MAT you need to do well in. As long as you don't underestimate it and do some practise, you'll do fine if you're an able candidate 
            
        
    

Of course, you could mention the USMs in your personal statement, or (better) get your referee to mention them. 

And yes, your grades are excellent!

do you take into account UMSs mentioned in applications even though the university doesn't require them? I've been told even if I score >95% and my referees mention them, they won't help my application

How do you take the IB and the AP? 0_o or is AP an out of school thing? 
I don't think you have to report your AP grades since you have your full IB Diploma. Moreover, IB is weighted more than AP grades.

Haha, I think you would, with an IB score of 40+.
Hell, with that sort of SAT score, why not go for Harvard/Yale/Princeton?

                (Original post by nulli tertius) 
                I did not say 40 was easy to get in IB.

Please read my post which is about average UCAS points.

Someone posted that the average UCAS point score for Oxford entrants was 603.

AAA at A level is 360 (or if one assumes AAAa, 420). 600 is A*A*A*A a and 610 is A*A*A*A*b

A far greater percentage of IB students score 40 (610 UCAS points) than A level students attain A*A*A*A a or A*A*A*A*b
            
        
    

You do realize that UCAS points are rubbish, don't you? I take the IB and I agree that 30 points is less than AAB, but come on, which university actually looks at UCAS points while making offers? Only the lower ranked ones, and certainly not Oxford. 

That said, the IB is underestimated in the UK. It hasn't gained that level of respect that it has in the US, Canada, and other countries. If you compare the amount of people who get 40 points to the amount of people who get AAA, I'm sure you will notice there are significantly less people in the IB category. 

And yeah, like Eddyward pointed out, universities like LSE, Imperial, UCL and Durham, which are just below the Oxbridge rung, usually offer 38 points where they ask for A*AA. Oxford on the other hand asks for 40 and AAA. Can you see the difference?

Again, you are not engaging with the point I am making which is about relative actual UCAS points scored not offers made.

The reason IB does not command the same respect isn't difficult to work out. English, Welsh and Northern Irish degrees are generally single honours subjects devised either to assume no prior subject knowledge or extensive prior subject knowledge and in each case predicated on prior study to a relatively high level. Most universities aren't that interested in the "all rounder".

Perhaps the university that is most open about this isn't Oxford or any of the London schools but Reading

This is their offer for history (but I think it is similar for all subjects)


    
    
    
        
            
                Pass the Diploma with scores of 6,6,5 in 3 Higher Levels including History
            
        
    

Essentially they don't care about the things which the IB trumpets. What they are saying is in effect "we want you to get decent scores in your three best subjects and we want one of them to be that which you are studying".

When IB students complain about the very high IB offers often made, they don't realise that what universities are doing is working out what somebody is likely to get if they got decent grades in their best subjects and converting that back into an overall IB grade. In other words they are doing what Reading is doing but not so openly.

            I'm considering applying to Oxford for Philosophy and Maths. My AS modules have been good so far (100,100,90) and I think I should do quite well in August.

However, I only moved to the UK in August so instead of taking GCSEs, I spent two years an American high school earning 'credits' towards graduation which I didn't complete as I moved. 

I know that Oxford looks at the MAT and GCSEs when looking at who to interview, so I'm wondering if having no GCSEs will be a huge disadvantage to the extent that there is no point applying?

Brilliant thank you!
Nothing in terms of work experience to date, organising some now for the upcoming summer holidays and over the next year, I've been told it's of a high importance! I thought I'd leave it until after my last GCSE exam is over so I didn't have to prioritize, and therefore could focus on my exams!

Edit: Forgot to mention, while this may seem irrelevant, I was told reading various Science magazines such as the New Scientist and Scientific American weekly is a great way to expand my knowledge, so I've been reading these weekly for the past 6 months or so. Is this worth anything I wonder? I heard a guy of which was offered an offer into Oxford from my school talked about something he done for his 'Extended Project' based on something he read in the New Scientist during his interview, and apparently it 'wowed' them in the depth that he was able to describe it to them, so I'm wondering, on top of work experience and other activities, is there anything else anyone would suggest doing to hearten up a future application for Oxford?

My sister read the BMA Student journal in the run-up to her applications. Dunno how useful it was though. Not sure she ever got asked about it. (Then again, she didn't get an interview for Oxford.) nexttime will tell you everything you need to know

                Good 

Just a slight note as it may be helpful.  While I was writing my personal statement, I was given very good advice from a teacher at my old college.  One thing she was very insistent on was that I should not mention the condition in my personal statement, unless it was very brief and demonstrated my suitability as a candidate.  There are two reasons for this:  firstly, the university will only take note if such information comes from a person of authority (i.e. the person who writes your reference), and also everything you say in your statement should be completely positive.  So I just very briefly said it helped me with self-motivation.

I don't think so here's a quote from their website:

"Successful candidates would typically have SAT Reasoning Test scores of at least 700 in Critical Reading, Mathematics and the Writing Paper, or ACT with a score of at least 32 out of 36. We would also expect Grade 5 in three or more Advanced Placement tests in appropriate subjects or SAT Subject Tests in three appropriate subjects at 700 or better."

That will be fine. Again from their website:

"15. What if I do not yet have any pre-existing academic qualifications, such as GCSEs or equivalents?

We do accept applications from candidates who have not yet obtained any certified academic qualifications: for example, some candidates who are due to sit IB examinations may not yet have any certified qualifications when they apply to Oxford. However, in order to give your application fair consideration, we do require some evidence of your academic achievements to date. So, if you do not have any certified examination results, it is very important to include on your UCAS form detailed information on your academic achievements. This may take the form, for example, of tests you have taken in school or college. It will also be helpful if your referee can give a detailed account of your academic achievement.  "

If you have AS qualifications that won't apply of course.

                Thanks!  I feel like a laze asking questions easily found on the FAQ, but I'm always nervous I'm misinterpreting!
            
        
    

I'm guessing it was you so thanks for the rep

            This is what happened to me mostly when applying for medicine. Since I already have my AP marks and Gr 12 marks, thats all they looked at. The averages they ask for on their website are usually for Gr. 12 as well. If you just started Gr.12, they look at your Gr. 11 marks to predict your future Gr. 12 marks. With UK schools as opposed to North American school, they really don't care about work experience unless you are applying for courses like Medicine. Also look at Cambridge, while you can only apply to one of them, its nice to have an idea of what both want.

EDIT. While I went to high school in Alberta and we do have different systems, so you still have extremely high marks.

There's inflation in Ontario, I've read marks in Alberta are hard to come by.

I've finished grade 12, so does that mean that I needn't include my grade 11 marks as my grade 12 marks are already finalized?

                The weight of your PS should be towards your aptitude for PPE.

Oxford are not really bothered about work experience - sorry. 

When you apply for a course at Oxford, they are trying to determine whether you have the aptitude for the degree, and it is an academic degree. 

The night school courses you are taking are slightly different - but I'm not really sure how to include them in your PS. I would use the resource on this website. 

Sorry that isn't a lot of help - I just don't want to advise you incorrectly. Keep badgering the admissions people, even if it's just to get them to give you another person/department to contact.

Finally - don't forget about the Management element of the course.
            
        
    

I've read some of the personal statements and some students throw in lines where they mention some work experience, although they don't go in depth. 

The night school classes I'm taking at the University of Toronto are:

Accounting: The Fundamentals
Business Economics
Capital Markets, Asset Valuation and Portfolio Management
Corporate Finance and Performance Analysis
Quantitative Methods for Business Management

Those pertain to the two programs I'll be applying for - Accounting & Finance and Economics - in the UK. I really want to mention them because they're a step above high school in Canada and from the personal statements I've read a lot of the students talk about education, how their past studies aid their future studies. 

I think I'm going to buy a book on personal statements. 

Do you know where I can go to get my personal statement peer edited? I'll go to family, but, from what I gather, the British personal statement to to the point, whereas the North American one is flashier.

When you submit your marks for UCAS, I am sure you will be able to mention them somewhere, I was able to put in my AP marks. I know there is some where you can get your PS edited here on TSR, but getting it edited it by family is never wrong. Your night courses should be something big, its above the general Canadian High School stuff. Don't buy any PS books if you ask for my opinion.
And with the Alberta thing, yeah other provinces do generally have a slightly inflated marks compared to Alberta, wonderful diploma exams worth 50% of our final mark.

Final question. I had an ~80% average in grades 9 - 11. Since I'm done grade 12 (97%) and working on night school classes at a university, should I bother mentioning my grade 11 marks?

Should I not put them and only disclose them if asked?

            I know someone who got grades pretty much the same as yours - she managed to get into Oxford to do Law  So yes - APPLY!

You can write about about your scholarship on your Personal Statement - it looks excellent as it shows academic ability and effort, and shows you are very interested in the subject.

A)Other uni's don't see who you applied to.
B) Literally anyone can APPLY to Oxford, doesn't mean they are particularly special or can get in.
I would apply if you like the Oxford area, work better/well if in a small tutorial of 1/2 people, are willing to work hard, and have a passion for your subject. It's one of five choices, so it's ok to have a dream/possible but not definite choice and have at least one realistic, and one slightly below your predicted grades.(In other words, don't apply for 5 Oxford courses) What do you want to study?

            Hi!

I am a Polish applicant in a Polish high school, where I'm studying to complete the national qualification - Matura. However, as I plan to apply to universities both in the UK (where Matura is considered) and the US (which only accept SATs), I will individually take the SATs. There is a certain chance that I will do better in the SATs than in Matura, and that's where my questions arise:

1. Is it possible for a foreign candidate to apply with qualifications that are not from his country and that are not available in his school? 

2. Is it possible to apply to Oxford with two different qualifications, the Matura and the SAT? So that if I managed to get an offer, it could say, for example "six SATs above 700 or three Matura exams above 90%"? And I could grant myself a place with achieving only one of these?

It's a bit of a crazy situation and neither UCAS nor Oxford's admissions page give a clear solution. 

So, what do you think?

1. Yes.

2. More likely, they'd just focus on one of those two sets of qualifications. Or they could ask for certain grades in both! If you want to know which is most likely, your best bet is to email the college you're considering applying to.

            I guess I'm sorta crashing here, so sorry, but I was wondering what kind of a chance I would have in earth sciences at Worcester? I'm from the US though, so I'm not sure if you really know what my scores mean....

Anyway

                Nope pretty sure history has an "a" for instance "a history vlass" 
            
        
    

I'm sorry, I should have written "words that stem from the word "history", like "historical" or "historic"". 

You're right, in one sense "history" doesn't take "an", but "historical" does. It is the correct usage, even though some people don't realize and therefore don't use it, but it appears in academic works pretty often. 

It is American English to use "a" not "an", and that is why people often don't use it. It's not very important in speech, as it largely depends on pronunciation, but in written academic studies/books (especially older ones) it's normal to use "an". 

I spent the last 2 years teaching English grammar in China, otherwise i'm pretty sure i'd never have noticed it either!

            Hello everyone!

I'm a dual UK&US citizen living in the states. I attended american high school but I would love to attend uni in the uk. I've seen the minimal requirements for Americans at Oxford, but I was interested to know if anyone knew more about what it really takes to get into oxford from the american high school system. 

These are my scores:
SAT: 2180/2400 
       -Critical Reading: 750/800
       -Math: 700/800
       -Writing: 730/800
ACT: 33/36
AP Tests: 
        - Human Geography: 5
        - European History: 4
        - United States History: 5
        - World History: 5
        - English Composition: 5
        - Psychology: 5

I'm also president of my 350 person class. I spent an extra year of high school living in Brazil, so I am also fluent in Portuguese and I am a year older than other students in my year because I will have completed 5 years of high school. I also am an officer in my school Model United Nations team, Business Club, Rotary Community Service Club, and Newspaper Club. I am also an Eagle Scout (same thing as a Queen Scout I believe). Not sure if my extra-curriculars matter for British uni's.

I appreciate any and all feedback. Thank you!

So: first and foremost- all of the advice given here, by anybody, is just our best guesses, and do not allow for the parts that hard to quantify here: your passion for your subject, your intellectual capacities in the field (v ability to do school), etc. So, it is entirely possible that you could take the HAT, do amazingly well, get an interview and dazzle there and they would offer a place. 

However. You are applying with all your testing done, so they would be making an unconditional offer, and you do not have the equivalent of 3 A level As in your field (you have the equivalent of an AAB). 

You asked about H&P, but with no politics or gov APs imo that is going to be tough, especially as it is also a very small course- only about 50/year. History would also be tricky, partly because you don't have 3 5's and partly because they will really want you to have some period of history in which you have specialized and I am guessing that you don't.
 
PPE is a better bet, as they aren't specific about subjects, though you don't have a lot that would make you an obvious candidate (no econ or math- your SAT is respectable, but no subject test). If you slammed the TSA that could get you an interview, and they could use your existing 5s.  

For a current example, my friend just got a place for History & Politics. She applied with a 2250 SAT, 5s in AP World, English Lit, English Lang, US Gov (and APEs, but that wasn't relevant), and was predicted 5s for AP US, Eur, Comp Gov and Latin at the end of senior year. She was offered her place conditional on getting 3 5's, of which 2 had to be Comp Gov and either US or Eur history. 

Hope that helps.....

Agreed on all except this. H&P aren't too fussed about Politics qualifications, me and quite a few others I know didn't take Politics A-Level or any international equivalents.

            Thank you for the great responses!
I'm a fool for not mentioning the classes that I am taking this year (my apologies). I forgot that senior year courses can seriously influence admissions to UK unis. 
I'm in AP Micro-Econ, AP Macro-Econ, AP Gov, AP Comparative Politics, AP Spanish, and AP AB Calc this year. Do you think these could help me get a conditional offer? Also, if I sign up for the October SAT II's (I presume Math I or II and maybe something else) would that help me or does AB Calc fulfill what they are looking for? Thank you for addressing my AP Euro score. I took that class when I was in 10th grade (16 years old), so while I was happy at the time for getting a 4 (being one of only a handle of students in my year to take the class) I wasn't sure if the age at when you took the test would affect UK admissions. I know the company that reports AP results to American unis give the grade/year at which you took the exam. Also, are there sample TSA's and HAT's online? I've struggled to find them.

Many thanks!

tbh, that changes things a *lot* (imo). H, H&P and PPE all become much more viable. Also means that they can give a conditional offer!  Btw, I heard at an Oxford road show that most American applicants apply for PPE, so you would have more American competition, and although the base marks for US qualifications don't look too bad, the # who get through is v v small- even with way above the base marks.

So...now you have 4 weeks to pick one that is your heart's desire (before you ask, H&P and PPE have similar acceptance rates, but one has about 50 places and one just under 300), write an essay that makes a convincing case for why you are a great candidate for that subject (including examples of outside reading that you have done), register for the TSA or HAT, get a teacher to write a good rec, choose at least one other UK uni (b/c you have a very good shot at many of the others, and it gives you a back up plan- suggest looking at Edinburgh's IR & Law programme, for a start), and get your UCAS app up!

Forgot to say...if you go for PPE they may make your mark on APCalc part of your condition, so be very careful that is you say you are predicted a 5 that you can get a 5- you would hate to lose the offer of a place b/c you didn't make your conditions! (on the other hand, they are really not interested in 4s- I think that they see an AP 5 as a barely adequate proxy for an A level A!). Anyway, go ahead with the SATII- can't hurt, and might give you a back up mark

            I'm currently in year 12 and am looking at different universities. I think perhaps, I'm aiming a little too high as I won't have as strong a academic profile compared to other potential applicants with a plethora of A* grades at GCSE. I got 4As,2Bs and 5Cs at GCSE. I attend a comprehensive state school. I was wondering whether if you have average grades at GCSE but your A - Level grades are exceptional ( A*,A,A) would you realistically have a chance at applying to Oxford? Do they normally request interviews? I'm a good talker, so perhaps if I do well at an interview, maybe that would increase my chances? Also do they select candidates purely on academic ability as although I may not have a plethora of A* grades at GCSE, I have previously and am currently participating in various extra-curriculum activities ( outside of school) that I feel will make my statement stronger, I am also incredibly enthusiastic and determined to succeed. I am also looking for relevant law work experience. I was wondering whether it's realistic applying to Oxford next year, I don't want to waste my choice. I'm intending on applying to Russell Group Universities, however I fully comprehend that Oxford University is incredibly difficult to get in to. So is it realistic or shall I discard any thoughts on applying to Oxford? I'M THINKING OF APPLYING FOR LAW

Also do they select candidates purely on academic ability as although I may not have a plethora of A* grades at GCSE, I have previously and am currently participating in various extra-curriculum activities ( outside of school) that I feel will make my statement stronger, I am also incredibly enthusiastic and determined to succeed. I am also looking for relevant law work experience. I was wondering whether it's realistic applying to Oxford next year, I don't want to waste my choice. I'm intending on applying to Russell Group Universities, however I fully comprehend that Oxford University is incredibly difficult to get in to. So is it realistic or shall I discard any thoughts on applying to Oxford? I'M THINKING OF APPLYING FOR LAW
            
        
    

Go for it, they don't care if you got lower GCSEs so long as your ASs are good (or so they say) however A*AA isn't exceptional, for law at Cambridge it is the standard offer and at Oxford one grade higher than their offer. They aren't really that fussed about extra curriculars. For a lot of subjects your UCAS and interview is 'scored' and all the candidates are ranked accordingly and the top however many will get a place. For law your LNAT score would be of utmost importance as to whether or not you get an interview.

                I'm currently in year 12 and am looking at different universities. I think perhaps, I'm aiming a little too high as I won't have as strong a academic profile compared to other potential applicants with a plethora of A* grades at GCSE. I got 4As,2Bs and 5Cs at GCSE. I attend a comprehensive state school.

Definitely apply. I was in a similar situation to you (different subject though), I too am a "good talker". It's one choice out of five and there are people with much lower grades than you who apply anyway, either you get rejected and go to a RG university or you go to Oxford! Don't get your hopes up, but if you get to the interview stage then give it your BEST SHOT. Go for it! You'll never get the chance to try for either Oxford or Cambridge again!

                Ok thanks, what News sources do you recommend reading? BBC news seems quite limited.
            
        
    

The Economist. - has wide coverage of EU, Asia, Africa, US, etc, not just the UK. Has a right-wing tint but is also fairly objective most of the time.

Guardian website.

US sites like salon.com.

If you can afford the magazine, Vanity Fair has great articles on the depth stories behind major events such as the financial crash, political crises, etc. Is strong on US and UK stories.

            I am determined to get a place at Oxford to read BA History and Politics. I am currently studying English Literature, Politics and History and an EPQ. I am predicted Cs because of my appalling GCSEs (AABCCC and Dist* and Pass - due to mitigating circumstances and a bad school), but I have been getting As in every subject apart from English. I received the highest mark in Year 12 in my politics mock (A) and scored an A on both of my history tests. However, I am getting Bs and Cs in English, but I can change that with more revision; and besides, I have only had one mock exam and I got a low B on it. My coursework is at an A and low A, but my exam should hopefully pull me up! My ECs aren't outstanding: American political author for a news blog, internship with local MP, internship with local paper and EPQ. Say if I get AAA and A (in my EPQ) at AS and get AAA at A2 will I have a chance at Oxford? Thanks!

            Depends how likely your department is to interview candidates and how you may do at a potential interview. Your GCSEs might put you at a disadvantage in being selected for interview, but who knows? Are you applying from America, and did you take those GCSEs alongside the US qualifications for that age?

                I got 10A*s and 2As at GCSE
I got 3As (English literature,history and biology) and a C (chemistry) for AS levels
I have extenuating circumstances
I want to do English literature/language at Oxford
I made my decision to submit an application an hour ago and I feel a bit sick.
I wasn't too keen on applying to Oxford as I don't think I'm good enough but my mum asked me if I'd regret not applying and I realised I would, so I've decided to go for it! Obviously my chances depend on the ELAT, personal statement,and my submitted essay but assuming that everything is to a high standard, and using what I look like on paper already, would I realistically be considered/get an interview? Be as blunt as you like  Thank you!
            
        
    

You will definitely get be considered. Whether you get an interview depends on everything APART FROM your results.
        <br /><br /><div style='width:100%;height:15px;background-color:blue;color:blue;'></div>
            I'm only in the same year as you but in my view OF COURSE YOU SHOULD APPLY IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO THERE, your AS results and subjects seem great to me. I'm applying and I got AABC in AS and one of my A levels is photography - but I'm passionate about my subjects and would love to be able to study them at Oxford. The way I see it, take a chance and maybe you'll get in, or settle somewhere you think you've got the "right" grades for and never know if they would have found you interesting.

Hey!
To be honest, Oxford don't really care about your SAT scores. 3A* and a B is a good prediction, and as long as your personal statement is well written and you do well on the TSA or HAT or whatever test you have to take, you should be able to land an interview. After that, it's in your own hands. Ask your counsellor at school if its worth you dropping Geography and applying with only the predicted 3A*s.
Hope that helped.

Those IGCSEs aren't ideal, but I don't think they'll rule you out completely. Oxford is unlikely to care about SATs once they see you're doing A Levels. I would focus more attention on nailing the TSA, because that's a key component in their assessment of PPE applicants.

            Hi everyone!
I'm an international applicant applying to Oxford Law this year. I'm planning to apply to Lady Margaret Hall, St Edmund Hall, or St Peter's. Can anyone chance me?
Six APs, 3 5's, 3 4's (5: World History, English Literature, English Language 4: US History, European History, Human Geography)
SAT 2190
various international awards related to forensics (if this will help at all)
I'm taking the SAT again on October 5th, and I'm pretty confident that I will get a much higher score. Is it possible to send the score results to Oxford after the 15th? 
Also, regarding the LNAT, how do you send your LNAT scores on the 20th?

SL Physics 6
SL Maths 6
SL Economics 7

                Hi guys, not sure if this is the correct thread but here goes.
Being an international student i am current studying theology in Turkey and aim to study my masters in Oriental studies at the university of Oxford,in 2016. However, i am a bit skeptical about my current results as the university at which i am studying implements the Bell curve system and my average subject mark is 80%, but upon conversion to a mark out of 4(GPA), due to the class average, equates to a score of less then three. Do you believe my average to be good enough to be taken under consideration? What exactly are the application requirements? would be very grateful if anyone studying an Ma in Oriental studies can help me. Thanks
            
        
    

Direct from the Oriental Studies website- 

"Applicants are normally expected to be predicted or to have achieved a first-class or an upper second class undergraduate degree (or equivalent international qualification). For applicants with a USA Grade Point Average (GPA), the basic minimum requirement for all courses is 3.5 out of 4.0. *If you hold non-British qualifications, you are advised to check with the National Recognition information Centre for the UK NARIC to find out how your qualifications match these requirements. NARIC will charge for their service. A Graduate Record Examination (GRE) score is not a formal requirement for applying for any of the facultys postgraduate courses. However, if one is available, please attach it to your application."

            Hello All! Brand new to the forum, but I wanted to ask for some quick advice. 

  I am currently studying in the US (as an american) for my BA in History and I hope to study at Oxford for grad school. My grades as of now are a 3.75 and I hope and plan to bring it up to a 3.8 (School average is about 2.9). 

  I want to apply to the MSc in African Studies and MSt in Global and Imperial History. Would anyone have advice on the application or what I can do in the mean time to help my self out?

                Why would you encourage them to apply for Cambridge?

Cambridge require your UMS and normally give offers to those with 90%+ on average. AAC is evidently not going to be that.
            
        
    

I can only speak with the information  I've got.  So in short I know 3 monsters one of whom is called Zakee he is basically like Ramanujan in Mathematics, well maybe not quite that good but he learnt 4 A level modules in 1 week. Does 3rd year Cambridge engineering questions for fun in his A level exams. And he got transferred  by  Oxford from mathematics to the engineering department (not a good thing) . The other two not quite advanced but one guy called Tom got 8* at GCSE and Got A*A*A* at A level and he applied for economics and he got completely rejected. Non of these guys are even socially awkward or anything. Both Tom and Zakee got into Cambridge and will be doing the course they want. Further more I've read many cases (5-6) where students have under performed quite drastically and still got a place offered to them at Cambridge. That is rare at Oxford. There was this case where a guy got I think 10+ A* at GCSE's and A*A*A*A* and he got rejected - he's from america the story is out there if you search for it.

Oh dear, I've lost count of the number of times I've had to explain this on TSR

It doesn't matter how many A*s at GCSE and A-Level someone has, such a significant proportion of applicants have those kind of grades it's not a differentiator. This is why Oxford use both admissions tests and interviews heavily.Which is precisely why you end up with people with 10+ A*s at GCSE and 4 A*s at A-Level but getting rejected, they can regurgitate the material at GCSE/A-Level, but they struggle with actual problem solving - it's all far too common.

Also, your story about someone being transferred by Oxford from maths to engineering is absolute rubbish.

                (Original post by fluteflute) 
                I agree those statistics would be fascinating if correct. The presentation looks official, but the statistics there don't line up with other statistics I have.

For example, it says the average Law student has 4.82 A*s, but I know that for 2012 Law applicants with 5+ GCSEs, 79% of their GCSEs were A* grades. Obviously 2010 isn't 2012, but put together, these stats suggest the average Law applicant only has about six GCSEs, which is totally implausible. The same is true of most subjects actually. So perhaps the stats in that presentation include internationals without GCSEs (e.g. Classics is top, because of few international students?), which if true, would make the figures there completely useless. Although I'm not convinced the numbers work for that either.

It's also worth noting that we are now entering the 2015 application cycle. A lot has changed in Oxford admissions since 2010. Pre-interview aptitude tests are much more common, and provide a way to shine without so good grades. Of course the typical student's grades are still very high.
            
        
    

I don't think internationals have been counted, the way the admission statistics database is set up, someone would have to intentionally set international students' GCSE # A*s column to 0 (by default, it's blank) - which would be a bit nonsensical. 

That said, the statistics look complete nonsense:

"The average applicant has around 6.2 A*s"

and yet only two subjects (Classics and Medicine) have an average of above 6.2, so I'd be interested to know how they managed to work that one out. What makes it even more bizarre is if they used the APS database to work these out (which they would've done) the breakdown by course will only include students who successfully matriculated, not applicants. So either the average applicant has a higher number of A*s than the average successful applicant (lol) or the statistics are nonsense.

            Hey guys! I am a US Graduate. B.Sc. in Biomedical Sciences. while in uni I tutored successfully enough to start my own business, also got into academia and have been teaching mathematics/physics/chem/bio.
I have fallen in love with mathematics and want to apply for Oxford's mathematics and computer science degree as an undergrad.
Together with stelar SAT's (took it just in case for admissions), and aced MAT, many hours volunteering and community involvements, what are my chances? Furthermore, what should I do in order to improve any chance I may have?
Thank you for your time, it's tough to get clear answers browsing the Oxford FAQ's and admissions information.
Thank you all for your responses.

I have fallen in love with mathematics and want to apply for Oxford's mathematics and computer science degree as an undergrad.
Together with stelar SAT's (took it just in case for admissions), and aced MAT, many hours volunteering and community involvements, what are my chances? Furthermore, what should I do in order to improve any chance I may have?
Thank you for your time, it's tough to get clear answers browsing the Oxford FAQ's and admissions information.
Thank you all for your responses.
            
        
    

It sounds like you would have a reasonably good chance  Nobody can know whether they'd get a place, but you would seem to have as good a chance as any.

Note that admissions is based on academic factors only - volunteering and community involvement is not taken into account.

            Hey! I am currently an A-Levels student. I would like to apply for History and Economics. However, I have no A-Levels History background. I took US History and World History in SAT subject tests instead. Will I be considered by Oxfo

Yes, probably. You will sit the HAT as well I think, which is arguably more important.

                I obtained a BA in Tourism Management (GPA: 3.23/4.0, my scores were poor when I was a freshman, but most major related courses are fine especially in later years, and my BA thesis was marked 89) at a China's recognized university, and then completed a MA in international relations and world history (merit, 66%) in Nottingham University. I want to do a PhD in East Asia studies/ Oriental studies. 

A failure expereince: Last year, A professor at Cambridge would like to take me as a PhD student after reviewing all my materials. Although both my BA and MA fall short of the required level (67+), he confirmed me that there shouldn't be any problems to be admitted, so I did not have a plan B at that time. But unfortunally, the application turned out to be unsuccessful. My potential supervisor was very sorry for this, he told me that as one member of their degree committee meeting, he strongly advocated and plead on my behalf, but unexpectally, most other members voted No for my application, and the key stumbling block was my less desirable transcript. He suggested me to take another taught masters in a recognized UK university in social anthropology (which is relevant to my PhD Project) before reapplying to them.

I then began to realize that the academic records are such an important thing in application. This year, I applied the Dphil at Oxford, the requirement for the course is a BA (2:1), that is 3.5 for GPA, a good masters degree (I have confirmed with them that my MA meets their requirement). But I am afraid my academic records just meet a half.. BA and MA results, which one is more important in PhD application? I will probably be disadvantaged due to the less desirable BA score, do I still stand a chance to get a place regarding to the academic records? (Even worse, my potential supervisor suddenly told me that she felt unable to supervise my doctoral studies after further reviewing my proposal and suggested me to try other Oxford teachers).

I also applied the Msc Social Anthropology at both Oxford and LSE, I am planning to apply for SOAS as well to help admission chances, most of my materials will fully meet the corresponding requirement, again the only problem is my BA transcript which is indeed less than satisfactory. Does the BA score really essential in application to UK's top universities? Anything I can do to remedy for that (I am not that familiar with UK's application)....

Looking forward to any suggestions~ 
            
        
    

Tutors look at your general academic history to assess whether they want to take you. All forms of postgraduate study require a lot of hard work, can be pretty draining and miserable at times and require a lot of perseverance.

Being honest, they will probably look at your BA and think it indicates laziness or a lack of ability. The fact it's from a Chinese university also won't have helped, as the standards are not perceived to be up to UK or US levels. So in effect to them you've done badly at a questionable course at a questionable university.

If your ultimate aim is places like Oxbridge or LSE, you're going to have to do what I call the "academic jump"- i.e. apply to a slightly lower ranked university to do another masters programme, and then on the back of this attempt to then apply to a higher ranked university on the basis of your (hopefully) excellent performance at the slightly lower ranked university. It is not uncommon to see people with several MA's before the time they get on to an Oxford DPhil course. 

Realistically I think the above sums up the reality of your situation in as blunt and useful way as I can put it for you.

                Congratulations on your A2 results - raising your As grades like that was a very good effort. The A-level combination you offer is fine for English Literature (ie Media Studies is perfectly acceptable). Oxford's University Admissions Office adds contextual data for schools to the UCAS form and the selectors will take this into account when assessing your prior attainment. 

You do not say if you already hold a University offer or are in clearing. If you are planning to apply post A-levels seeking an unconditional offer, it is worth thinking how to use your gap year (most applicants combine work with other activities that relate to their future academic studies in some way).
            
        
    

Hi thanks for the reply, I have a defferred offer from Exeter but the plan was to always to reject it and  reapply in my gap year because I wanted to take my time and visit unis, which I did not have a chance to do in year 13. In my gap year, I hope to read a lot, apply for a 6 month exchange program where I will study in a US high school. I will hopefully study a combination of different subjects there. Work for money, continue to learn French and do an internship at a law firm and a PR firm. I am currently sorting and applying to these things. 

Will my AS grades be a big disadvantage? Or do I stand a decent chance of at least getting an interview, thank you.
        <br /><br /><div style='width:100%;height:15px;background-color:blue;color:blue;'></div>
            I know someone who got into BioSci at Oxford with Biology, Chemistry, Photography and Art. But they got 4 A*s.

They also took a gap year and went travelling around America in it.

In short, it's possible to be accepted by Oxbridge with 'soft' subjects and a gap year, but your science grades need to be A*s. 

All I can say is, you won't know if you don't try!

            I'll apply to PPE Oxford this year. Scores:
SAT Reasoning 2300+, but I'll get grade in 22 oct so that score will be predicted
SAT Math II 770, SAT French 760, SAT World History 790
AP Macro/Micro Econ. 5, but I'll have several more AP's which have a little low scores like Europ. Hist. 4, Calc. 3.
TSA 75-85 in practice tests
Is there any chance for interview? Do I have anyway to minimize damage from low APs?
And also is it possible to get a conditional offer without stating any predicted grades or to get an unconditional offer with some predicted grades?

You meet the entry requirements (the SATs mean you make it, even if the APs are low).

The main factor in deciding if you get an interview will be your TSA performance. 75-85 is likely enough for that, though of course it varies each year.

If the form asks for predicted grades (I think it will) then you need to put it in. It would be very unusual for them to give you an unconditional offer unless you had already met the entry requirements. I think you (if given an offer) would be asked to simply get "SAT Reasoning Test with at least 1,400 in Critical Reading and Mathematics and also 700 or more in Writing, giving a combined score of at least 2,100".

Ok, I have two choices. First, I don't send any AP scores, I apply with subject tests and take several A levels in this year, repoting predicted scores. Or I apply with APs and subject tests, and indicate(in teacher rec. maybe) that I've self studied those APs without any teacher assistance or any lecture, and that my school has a demanding program which also requires much effort, and that the low score in calculus does not reflect my abilities in maths, and that I'll retake those APs. Which one would be better you think?

            Hey,

Have always wanted to study at law at Cambridge, but just realised requirements are lower for Oxford and seem to be doing alright at LNAT and LSAT practise test...

AS levels are:
A - English Lit (89%)
A - Art (84%)
A - Maths (80%)
B - History (79%)
want to resit C1 module cause I only got 76 UMS but 91 on C2 but not sure how theyd look at that? 
Taking English Lit, History ad Maths this year and predicted grades are A*AA. Also doing an EPQ in Law, how much will they care about that?

GCSE grades are low tho, 3A*s, 7A's and a B plus a D in further Maths (really didn't try, and probably countered by my A level?) but its a FSMQ not a GCSE.
Is the D and B going to stop me from getting a place/interview or should this be enough?

I suspect your GCSEs are on the low side for Oxford Law, but they do not rule you out either. You should work on nailing the LNAT (LSAT is used for Canadian/ US JD admissions and is irrelevant for UK law programmes). 

The EPQ won't form a part of the offer, but you can certainly talk about it in your personal statement as an example of how you've tried to explore and develop your interest in law as an academic subject.
        <br /><br /><div style='width:100%;height:15px;background-color:blue;color:blue;'></div>
            The LSAT test are recommened by LNAT because there are only 2 official LNAT tests but theLSAT (according to them) is simile enough and practise tests are more readily available. 
Okay so as long as I get a good LNAT score I still have a chance? Does anyone know what I should be aiming for??

                I mean, what sort of university ignores academic records available for their assessment, especially when they have to select candidates to invite to interview/test???

Welcome to medicine in the UK! 

I think its driven by the fact that patients are far, far more likely to complain that the doctor wasn't nice to them than the doctor gave the wrong antibiotics or did the wrong scan. Even though the former makes no long term difference and the latter could, in theory, kill them. 

Its also driven by our examination system, which does not distinguish the top end well at all. Especially pre-A*s. 

No other country does selection on these criteria that I'm aware. Its all about academics (and, in the US, how many musical instruments you play etc  )

Yes, I've seen the news about the statistic showing about what patients complain most, but it doesn't mean universities can focus less on their applicants' academic ability, does it??

And regarding assessing A-level results, that's exactly the reason Cambridge looks at UMS for every module applicants have taken, isn't it?

You can try looking for a practice book - I believe mine was from Kaplan? Worked pretty well. 

The average was 22.3 for 2014/2015. I was in the first batch of students to use the 42 question format, and I scored 26 (average for my year was 17.7). Some of my batchmates scored 30 and upwards, so I'm going to guess upwards of 32 /33 probably. The higher the better, especially since your grades aren't exactly top notch by Oxford Law standards.
